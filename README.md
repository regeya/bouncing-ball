# Bouncing Ball in HTML5

[Link to the animation](https://regeya.github.io/bouncing-ball/bouncing_ball.html)


A bouncing ball animation I originally made for a Flash ad, and converted the bouncing ball part over to HTML5.  The HTML5 and JavaScript is MIT licensed; the embedded basketball art and wood floor graphic are not.

The code itself is an old-school pseudo physics animation, accumulating a distance as the ball goes toward a target.  When the ball hits the "floor", that accumulator is negated.  At random intervals the accumulator is assigned a random value to make it start bouncing again.
